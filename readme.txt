This is a very old version of the OTA Hotel Management solution, this version is no longer supported by e-Novate Pte Ltd and does not work properly on PHP versions 7 and above.
OTA Hotel Management has been renamed e-Bridge Hotel and has reverted to a freeware with a paid version providing real connectivity.

The free version can be downloaded from www.e-bridge.co, it comes pre-installed with a WAMP or MAMP server and is ready to install and run.
Free version only requires a valid email to download.  
Premium version requires hotel/property verification as we connect to OTAs.

The e-Bridge Hotel Premium is a fully cloud ready application and  contains:
- 'Rooms' online booking engine
